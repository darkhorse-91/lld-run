1. Object creation logic becomes too convoluted
2. Initializer is not descriptive
    - Name is always __init__
    - Cannot overload with same sets of arguments with different names.
    - Can turn into 'optional parameter hell'
3. Wholesale object creation (non-piecewise, unlike Builder) can be 
   outsourced to 
    - A separate method (Factory Method)
    - May exist in a separate class (Factory)
    - Can create hierarchy of factory with Abstract Factory

Factory ->
A component responsible solely for the wholesale not piecewise creation of objects.
